Graphql schema storage as dockerized on-premise service for federated graphql gateway server
(based on [apollo server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/)) as alternative to [Apollo studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/)

## Features

- Stores versioned schema for graphql-federated services
- Serves schema for graphql gateway based on provided services & their versions
- Validates new schema to be compatible with other _running_ services
- Provides UI for developers to see stored schema & its history diff
- Stores & shows in UI persisted queries passed by the gateway for debugging

## Roadmap

- client tracking (for breaking changes)
- schema usage tracking (for breaking changes)
- separate APQs (use cache only) from backend-registered persisted queries (use DB only)

## Installation

Assuming you have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) & [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed:

```
nvm use
npm install
npm run build
docker-compose up --build
```

Open http://localhost:6001

## Configuration

We rely on docker network and uses hostnames from `docker-compose.yml`.
Check `app/config.js` to see credentials that node service uses to connect to mysql & redis and change it if you install it with own setup. If you use dynamic service discovery (consul/etcd), edit `diplomat.js`

`app/config.js` will look for the following environment variables and will use their values if available for connecting to MySQL and Redis. The names of the
variables should be self-explanatory.

```shell
DB_HOST (defaults to 'gql-schema-registry-db')
DB_USERNAME (defaults to 'root')
DB_PASSWORD (defaults to 'root')
DB_PORT (defaults to 3306)

REDIS_HOST (defaults to 'gql-schema-registry-redis')
REDIS_PORT (defauts to 6379)
REDIS_USERNAME (defaults to '')
REDIS_SECRET (defaults to '')
```

`ASSETS_URL` is another environment variable that can be configured to control the url that web assets are served from. This can be used either when running the Node process locally in development mode,
or when the registry sits behind a reverse proxy.

## Use cases

### Validating schema on deploy

On pre-commit / deploy make a POST /schema/validate to see if its compatible with current schema.

### Schema registration

On service start-up (runtime), make POST to /schema/push to register schema (see API reference for details).
Make sure to handle failure.

## Architecture

### Tech stack

Frontend (`/client` folder)

- react
- apollo client
- styled-components

Backend (`/app` folder)

- nodejs 14
- express, hapi/joi
- apollo-server-express, dataloader
- redis 6
- knex
- mysql 8

### Components

graphql-schema-registry service is one of the components for graphql federation, but it needs tight
integration with gateway. Check out [examples folder](examples/README.md) on how to implement it. Note however, that
gateway is very simplified and does not have proper error handling, cost limits or fail-safe mechanisms.

### DB structure

Migrations are done using knex

## Development

### DB migrations

To create new DB migration, use:

```bash
npm install knex -g
knex migrate:make my_migration_name_here --migrations-directory migrations
```

### Contribution

- Before making PR, make sure to run `npm run version` & fill [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

## API documentation

### Rest API

#### GET /schema/latest

Simplified version of /schema/compose where latest versions from different services is composed. Needed mostly for debugging

#### POST /schema/compose

Lists schema based on passed services & their versions. Used by graphql gateway to fetch schema based on current containers

##### Input params

- services{ name, version}

If `services` is not passed, schema-registry tries to find most recent versions. Logic behind the scenes is that schema with _highest_ `added_time` OR `updated_time` is picked as latest. If time is the same, `schema.id` is used.

#### POST /schema/push

Validates and registers new schema for a service.

##### Input params

- name
- version
- type_defs

#### POST /schema/validate

Validates schema, without adding to DB

##### Input params

- name
- version
- type_defs

#### POST /schema/diff

Compares schemas and finds breaking or dangerous changes between provided and latest schemas.

- name
- version
- type_defs

#### DELETE /schema/delete

Deletes specified schema

##### Input params

- name
- version

#### GET /persisted_query

Looks up persisted query from DB & caches it in redis if its found

##### Input params

- key

#### POST /persisted_query

Adds persisted query to DB & redis cache

##### Input params

- key
- value
